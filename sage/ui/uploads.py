"""Taking files off the uploader widget, once each, with a reason when one is refused.

The widget is the awkward part: it re-reports every file it holds on every rerun,
nothing here can reach in and remove one, and a refusal has to outlive the run that
produced it. What is *in* a file — whether it is text, whether it is an image, how it
is decoded — is `sage/files.py`, which knows nothing about Streamlit.
