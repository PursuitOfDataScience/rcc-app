"""Discover, clean and chunk the documentation corpus.

Three seams, in the order a file passes through them:

* **`profile.Source`** — which trees exist, what they are called, and what is in them.
* **`readers`** — how a file in one of those trees becomes a document and its chunks.
* **`urls`** — where that document is published, which is what a citation links to.

`build()` walks the trees and does none of that work itself. It used to: the walk
branched on the literal source names "docs" and "web" to pick a chunker, to decide
whether a file's own URL mattered, and to decide which exclusion rule applied — three
places a second corpus had to be threaded through, in a function whose job is to open
files.
