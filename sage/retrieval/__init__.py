"""Retrieval: one interface, one engine shipped, and the seam between them.

    from sage import corpus, retrieval
    index = retrieval.build(corpus.build())

`build` reads the engine's name from the profile, so swapping BM25 for something
else is a line of TOML and a module that registers itself:

    # myengine.py
    from sage.retrieval import engines
    engines.register("embeddings", lambda corpus, retrieval, doc="": MyIndex(...))

Importing `sage.retrieval.bm25` here is what puts the built-in engine in the
registry. A third-party engine registers itself the same way, on import — which its
own module has to arrange, because this package cannot import what it has not heard of.
