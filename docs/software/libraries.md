# Libraries

There are several commonly used libraries that are available as modules on Midway2 and Midway3.
After loading the module into your environment, you can find several environment variables and paths are added:
```
module show [module-name]
```
These added paths can be used in your Makefile or in the build configuration with [cmake](cmake.md){:target='_blank'}.

## GSL

The GNU Scientific Library [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/){:target='_blank'} is a numerical library for C and C++ programmers.

```
module load gsl
```
which sets up the paths and environment variables for the libraries.

## FFTW3

[FFTW3](https://www.fftw.org/){:target='_blank'} can be loaded via
```
module load fftw3
```
which sets up the paths and environment variables for the libraries.

## Intel oneAPI MKL

[Intel oneAPI MKL](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/get-started-with-mkl-for-dpcpp/top.html){:target='_blank'} can be loaded via
```
module load mkl
```
which sets up the paths and environment variables for the libraries. The MKL libraries support core math functions include BLAS, LAPACK, ScaLAPACK, sparse solvers, fast Fourier transforms, and vector math.

## NVIDIA HPC SDK

[NVIDIA HPC SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/hpc-sdk){:target='_blank'} provides another toolset for compiling GPU-enabled C/C++/Fortran codes via OpenACC. NVIDIA HPC SDK also provides a set of GPU-optimized tools and math libraries. These compilers are available through the `nvhpc` module.
