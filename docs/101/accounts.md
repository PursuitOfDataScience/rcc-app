### What to Do After Completing a Project

Once your project is complete, it's essential to ensure smooth handover and file management. Follow these steps:

1. **Grant Group Access**: Allow your group members access to your files using the following SSH command:

    ```bash
    chmod 2771 -R <your_folders>
    ```

    For example:

    ```bash
    chmod 2771 -R /project/drpepper/cell-tracker
    ```

    This command sets the appropriate permissions for your folders.

2. **Assign Group Ownership**: Ensure that your account's PI is the group owner of your files with:

    ```bash
    chgrp pi-drpepper -R <your_folders>
    ```

    For example:

    ```bash
    chgrp pi-drpepper -R /project/drpepper/cell-tracker
    ```

    This step facilitates proper file management within your research group.
