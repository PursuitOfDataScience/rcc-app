Still, you risk your file transfer being interrupted if you get disconnected from the internet.​Globus and Samba (SMB) are two ways to connect to a data mover node.'/>

## Connecting

Midway clusters to your personal computer using Globus. See Transfer Files with Globus for help moving files between collections. This <a href='https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal' target='_blank'>guide</a> also describes how to make your computer a Globus endpoint so you can move files between your local system and RCC cluster (Midway2 and Midway3). In addition, you might find Globus documentation helpful if you need to schedule transfer files <a href='https://docs.globus.org/' target='_blank'>here</a>.
