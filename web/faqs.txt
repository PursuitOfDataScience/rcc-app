Frequently Asked Questions & Answers
General Questions
Why should I use Skyway?
Skyway removes the complexity of using cloud resources. If you can run jobs on Midway, you can easily burst a job into the cloud. With the elasticity of the cloud resources, users can seamlessly access more computing capacity and storage from Skyway.
Do I need an account with the Cloud provider in addition to my RCC account?
No. Your RCC user account and credentials can be used to access both Midway and Skyway. However, you need to contact RCC to activate your access through Skyway.
What are the costs associated with this service?
There is no cost to use Skyway to burst in the cloud, however the cost associated with running jobs or storing data in the cloud is the responsibility of the user. The RCC has a limited amount of credits to use, at no cost, for pilot projects being used for the development of Skyway.
How can I get help if I have an issue using Skyway?
