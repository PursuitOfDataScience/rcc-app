Title: Workshops and Training | Research Computing Center
================================================================================
The Research Computing Center (RCC) conducts interactive workshops on a variety of topics relevant to research computing. Past workshop topics have included introductory, intermediate, and advanced seminars on programming languages; data management tools and best practices; and sessions focused on using Midway and other RCC resources. Unless otherwise noted, all of our workshops are in-person due to their hands-on nature.
In addition to workshops led by the RCC staff, the RCC routinely invites industry experts and hardware and software vendors to teach courses focused on specific systems.

Laurence-Chasen A note about experience levels The RCC communicates the expertise needed to get the most out of a workshop by labeling it with an experience level. An level workshop presupposes little or no familiarity with the topic at hand. An level workshop requires some degree of familiarity with the methods being used. An level workshop is for users who are already fluent with the methods and tools involved.
Each workshop's description includes the workshop's experience level (Click on course title for details). If you are unsure whether a given workshop will be taught at too advanced or too basic a level for you, feel free to contact the RCC for information.
Below is a small selection of workshops we have offered in previous years:
