Title: Director's Welcome | Research Computing Center
================================================================================
Welcome to the Research Computing Center (RCC) at the University of Chicago
It is an honor to continue serving as the Director of the Research Computing Center (RCC) at the University of Chicago. Over the past 12 years, the RCC has grown into a cornerstone of the University's research ecosystem, supporting faculty and researchers with advanced computational resources and expert technical support.
We are entering a transformative era in research computing, driven by the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and, on the horizon, quantum computing. These technologies are not just reshaping the way we conduct research--they are expanding what is possible across every field of study. The RCC is committed to being at the forefront of this change, enabling new discoveries and pushing the boundaries of scientific knowledge.
Since our founding, faculty needs have consistently driven our programs and services, and we have continually adapted to meet the evolving demands of the UChicago research community. Our mission remains unchanged: to enable research by providing researchers access to advanced computing, data storage, and visualization resources, along with a team of computational scientists skilled in various domains. But today, we are more committed than ever to amplifying the impact of research with AI and to preparing for the quantum revolution that will soon reshape the landscape of scientific inquiry.
The needs and aspirations of our faculty and researchers are at the heart of everything we do. Your collaboration and feedback guide our programs, services, and resources, ensuring that we stay aligned with the dynamic demands of modern research. We are excited to continue this journey with you and to provide the tools and expertise that will help you reach new heights in your work.
The RCC is not just a resource--it is a partner in your research. Together, we will continue to explore, innovate, and push the frontiers of knowledge in this new era of discovery. I am proud of what we have achieved so far and am truly excited for the future. The possibilities ahead are endless, and we are here to ensure you have the best resources, tools, support, and collaboration to realize those possibilities.
Thank you for being part of this incredible community, and we look forward to continuing to support your work today, tomorrow, and well into the future.
