Title: Resources | Research Computing Center
================================================================================
The Research Computing Center (RCC) provides access to high-end computing and visualization resources, secure computing environment, high-capacity storage and backup, software, high-speed networking, and hosted data sets.
Resources are centrally managed by the RCC staff who ensure the accessibility, reliability, and security of the compute and storage systems. This is a major advantage of using RCC resources versus an independently owned and operated compute cluster and storage system. Being centrally managed allows the researchers to focus on their research and not worry about the maintenance of computational infrastructures. The visualization lab in Crerar Library offers researchers the opportunity to visually explore and share their data. The RCC's software library grants access to a vast array of programs. MidwayR is similar to the Midway computing environment but also has been equipped with tools and software needed to meet the highest levels of secure data protection. A high-throughput network connects the Midway compute cluster to the University of Chicago campus network and the public internet through a number of high-bandwidth uplinks. To support data-driven research, the RCC hosts a number of large datasets that can be accessed within the RCC compute environment.
